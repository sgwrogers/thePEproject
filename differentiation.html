      <p><span>As Physical Education teachers, it is our responsibility to make sure our lessons are barrier-free and meet the diverse needs of our students – this is most commonly known as differentiation</span> [1, 2]. It has best been described as ‘the matching of work to the differing capabilities of individuals or groups of pupils in order to extend their learning’ [3]. By planning for differentiation and integrating all pupils we ensure every student’s fundamental right to access our wonderful subject, whilst also modelling a socially inclusive society which is based upon mutual understanding and respect for individual diversity [1]. Thus, it is essential that we acknowledge students as individuals that learn in different ways and that we need to plan for differentiation by setting suitable learning challenges for all [4, 5].</p>

        <p>To begin planning for differentiation, teachers should have an open mind, positive attitude and willingness to modify and adapt learning, teaching and assessment strategies and practices [1, 6]). Secondly, it is helpful for teachers to know the common principles of differentiation which in the PE community is known as the STTEP principle (see diagram below) [5, 7]. </p>

        <p>The STTEP principle is not the be all and end all of differentiation, but it useful when you need to make changes for a lesson [5]. Nevertheless, within the STTEP principle, we can find all other differentiation strategies fall under. For example, if we look in detail at ‘Task’ from the STTEP principle, we can find numerous approaches such as:</p>

        <p>Most of the strategies for differentiation are self-explanatory. One important principle to consider is how students are grouped as in Differentiation by Grouping. Generally students are grouped based on their ability, with the most able students working together and the least experienced students doing the same. However, as Physical Educators we have to be careful not to judge ability based on our perceptions of student’s physical development and skill. Rather, we need to view pupil’s competencies more holistically as they may well possess advanced analytical and evaluative skills or even leadership qualities beyond their years [5]. As a result, when planning for differentiation by grouping we should utilize a range of grouping strategies such as mixed ability groups, for example, as they may have a greater potential for student progression as students can learn from each other and develop skills, attributes and values that are both inside and outside of the physical domain [2]. In order to become more competent as teaching practitioners, it is important that we invest time in both planning and trialing a wide array of differentiation strategies with our students and take note of what does and doesn’t work with certain groups and individuals. Furthermore, if you still feel inexperienced in this area, there is a wealth of literature available on this subject matter and most schools have a learning support team that would be encouraged by a visit from a PE teacher.</p>
